# NuclearReaction
Physics work

A simple game in javascript using HTML5 canvas element.

(Made in javascript language and Atom text editor | it is likely that works with all browsers, but only tests occurred with google chromer)

# Game Resume
The user will control one of the tree atoms: hydrogen, helium or lithium, and he need dodge from neutrinos played against the atom, case the atom is reached, his will break and will occur an atomic explosion

# TODO: 
	- Add a GUI inteface with sound volume settings)
	- Add the menu when the user can choice the atom to use .
	
	      Obs: No picture or audio element beyond the classical music of Mozard, can be added to the project.

 - The hydrogen is the easy state, the helium the medium and the lithium hard state.

- The atom format will change the moviment speed and the size, that way it will be more difficult the not being hit by a neutrino.
